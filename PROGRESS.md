# TankGame — Progress

Living status tracker. The full spec is `docs/research/development-plan.md`; this
file records what is actually done and what is next.

## Current status: **M1 complete** (2026-06-02) — entity-spine foundation (S1) in progress

The CI/CD pipeline is live and every merge to `main` builds, tests, and deploys. M1's core
loop ships (drive + shoot + instructions overlay); next work is the S1 entity-spine
refactor — see "In progress" below.

### Live surfaces

| Surface | State |
|---------|-------|
| Worker `tankgame-worker.vodkadav.workers.dev/healthz` | ✅ 200 (Sentry-wrapped) |
| Cloudflare Pages landing page | ✅ deployed (per `CF_PAGES_PROJECT`) |
| Android debug APK | ✅ published to the rolling [`canary`](https://github.com/Vodkadav/TankGame/releases/tag/canary) GitHub Release (~79 MB, arm64-v8a) |

### M0 tickets (all done)

T1 monorepo scaffold · T2 Worker skeleton (`/healthz`) · T3 Godot C# client skeleton ·
T4 NetArchTest five-layer rules · T5 `ci.yml` (lint, arch, build + **headless GoDotTest**, worker) ·
T6 `deploy.yml` (Worker + Pages + **Android APK release**) · T7 i18n (en/es/dk) ·
T8 ADR-0001 (layered architecture) · T9 ADR-0002 (monorepo + CI/CD) ·
T10 pre-commit secret-scan hook · T11 Sentry in Worker · T12 Sentry in Godot client.

### Deferrals resolved

- **Android APK export** — built via the .NET→Android Gradle custom-build path; debug-signed
  with an in-job keystore (no secret). Required enabling `gradle_build/use_gradle_build`,
  dropping `armeabi-v7a` (.NET targets arm64/x86_64), and ETC2/ASTC VRAM compression.
- **GoDotTest scene-test runner** — `Bootstrap.cs` `--run-tests` entry runs the scene tests
  headless inside Godot and gates CI (GoDotTest 2.0.34, `Godot.NET.Sdk` 4.6.2).

## M1 complete — one tank, empty arena, moves and shoots (local)

The web→Android plan revision is done, so M1 is unblocked (target: Android APK + desktop
dev build; 60 fps on the Galaxy A56).

- **T1 — Domain interfaces** ✅ `ITank`, `IProjectile`, `IInputSource`, `IArena` (pure C#,
  `System.Numerics`, no Godot) with xUnit contract tests in `client/tests/Domain/`.
- **T3 — `Tank` (GameLogic)** ✅ moves at constant speed, faces movement, aims turret;
  9 xUnit tests in `client/tests/GameLogic/`.
- **T4 — `Projectile` (GameLogic)** ✅ travels straight, dies on `IArena` hit (snaps to point).
- **T10 — ADR-0003** ✅ interface-first rule + `IServiceName` lives in Domain.
- **T2 — tank sprite** ✅ **placeholder** body+turret PNGs (PIL-generated; to be replaced by
  Kenney CC0 — see `docs/credits/assets.md`).
- **T5 — `TankView`** ✅ Node2D binding an `ITank`: node follows position, Body/Turret
  sprites rotate with chassis/aim; GoDotTest verifies load + model mirroring.
- **T7 — `KeyboardMouseInputSource`** ✅ WASD move, mouse aim (vs viewport centre),
  click/space fire; pure `ReadMove`/`ComputeAim` helpers with xUnit tests.
- **T9 — drivable wiring** ✅ `Arena.tscn`/`ArenaScene` builds the input source, a `Tank`,
  a `TankView`, and a following `Camera2D`. App-init (Sentry, translations) moved to `Bootstrap`; the M0
  boot-label scene (`Main.tscn`/`MainScene`) is retired (Sentry test now targets
  `SentryBootstrap`). **The tank is drivable** — launch via the desktop shortcut.
- **T4-view / T6 — firing + projectile + walls** ✅ `RectArena` (analytic rectangle
  raycast, GameLogic) bounds the arena; firing (rate-limited) spawns a `Projectile` +
  `ProjectileView` from the turret that travels and despawns on a wall hit; the arena
  draws its wall border. **The tank moves and shoots** — M1's core loop.
- **T8 — instructions overlay** ✅ `ArenaScene` builds a screen-space `CanvasLayer` + `Label`
  ("WASD to move, mouse to aim, click to fire") wired to the `m1.instructions` key; EN/ES/DK
  strings in `strings.csv`; GoDotTest forces each locale and asserts the rendered line.
- M1 done. (Tank↔wall collision is deferred to M2's wall grid; M1's tank roams the open arena.)

## In progress: extensibility foundation (roadmap S1)

The expansion wishlist (new ammo types, tank upgrades, smart walls/doors, wormholes,
droppables, drones, points of interest, hide spots) is catalogued in
`docs/research/feature-roadmap.md`, which maps every idea to seven foundational system
abstractions (**S1–S7**). Building the systems first makes the content cheap to add.

**S1 — entity spine** (design: `docs/adr/PROPOSAL-entity-spine.md`): a `World` that owns
and `Step`s many entities with spawn/despawn events, ending the `ArenaScene`
hand-spawning. Decisions settled in the proposal: `ITank`/`IProjectile` **extend**
`IEntity`; spawners get `IWorld` **injected at construction**; **tick ownership moves out
of the views** (they call `model.Step` today).

- **S1-T1 — `IEntity` + `IWorld` contracts** ✅ Domain interfaces (`Id`/`Position`/
  `IsAlive`/`Step`; `Entities`/`Spawn`/`EntitySpawned`/`EntityDespawned`/`Step`) with
  `EntityContractTests` + `WorldContractTests` (pure C#, no Godot). Scoped to contracts
  only — `ITank`/`IProjectile` adopt `: IEntity` in S1-T3/T4 alongside the impl changes.
- **S1-T2 — `World` impl (`GameLogic`)** ✅ owns entities in insertion order; `Spawn`
  adds + raises `EntitySpawned`; `Step` advances every entity, then reaps the dead and
  raises `EntityDespawned`. `Step` snapshots the live set first, so a mid-step spawn (the
  future-spawner seam) cannot corrupt iteration and the child is deferred to the next tick.
  `WorldTests` (7) verify it against the S1-T1 contract semantics.
- **S1-T4 — `Projectile` → `IEntity`** ✅ (done before T3: T3's `Tank` spawns a
  `Projectile` into `IWorld`, which needs `Projectile` to be an `IEntity` — the proposal
  listed T3→T4 but the spawn dependency runs the other way). `IProjectile` extends
  `IEntity` (empty body); `Projectile` assigns a stable `Guid Id`. `ProjectileTests` add
  Id-assigned/stable/unique.
- **S1-T3 — `Tank` → `IEntity` + owns the fire rule** ✅ `ITank` extends `IEntity` (adds
  only `Rotation`/`TurretRotation`); `Tank` assigns a `Guid Id`, is always alive (no health
  until S3), and takes an injected `IWorld` + `IArena`. `Step` spawns a `Projectile` into
  the world when `Fire` is held and the cooldown has elapsed — the rule moved out of
  `ArenaScene._Process`. `ArenaScene` now builds the `World`, subscribes once to
  `EntitySpawned`/`EntityDespawned` to map spawned projectiles to `ProjectileView`s, and
  calls `world.Step` per frame. **`ProjectileView` became a pure mirror here** (pulled
  forward from T5) because the world owning the projectile tick is what reaps the dead and
  avoids a `world.Entities` leak. `TankTests` cover the migrated fire rule (spawn, rate
  limit, aim) + `Id`/`IsAlive`; `ProjectileViewTests` rewritten mirror-only.
- **Next → S1-T5** — the remaining, riskier half of the tick inversion: spawn the **initial
  tank** through `world.Spawn` (not hand-wired), make **`TankView` a pure mirror** (stop
  calling `model.Step`; `world.Step` advances the tank too), and generalize the spawn→view
  factory to a type-switch over `ITank`/`IProjectile`. `ArenaSceneTests` (TankView +
  Camera2D + walls) must stay green. Then **S1-T6** (promote the proposal to a numbered ADR
  and update this file).

S1 is the systems-foundation slice and is **not** yet a numbered milestone in
`development-plan.md`; **M2 — static labyrinth + destructible walls** remains the next
numbered milestone. Sequencing S1 vs M2 is an open call (see `feature-roadmap.md` §6).
