// The pre-game lobby state machine (multiplayer milestone, web-export.md §5). One MatchRoom DO owns a
// LobbyState; clients send LobbyCommands over a JSON control channel and the DO broadcasts the new
// state. Up to 4 players pick a mode (free-for-all or two teams), ready up, and any player can start
// the match — a short countdown then hands off to the binary game relay. This module is the pure,
// engine-free heart of that flow so it is exhaustively unit-testable (the DO is a thin shell over it).

// and the relay cap all size themselves off this one constant.
