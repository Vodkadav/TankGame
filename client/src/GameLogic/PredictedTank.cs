/// <summary>Client-side prediction + reconciliation for the local player's tank (M3-T7). The
/// host is authoritative, but waiting a round-trip before the local tank moves would feel laggy,

/// arrives, <see cref="Reconcile"/> snaps the tank to the host's authoritative state and replays
/// only the inputs the host has not yet acknowledged — so a correct prediction is invisible and a
/// wrong one is pulled smoothly toward the truth.
///
/// The movement model mirrors the host's real GameLogic <see cref="Tank"/> exactly (ADR-0019
/// step 4): each tick advances by <c>move · speed · dt</c> (the same per-tick distance the host's
/// <see cref="Tank.Step"/> produces when stepped at the guest's fixed tick), resolves each axis
/// independently, allows a move only when the leading edge (centre + <see cref="Tank.CollisionRadius"/>)
/// clears a wall, faces the movement direction, and aims the turret at the input. Because the host
/// runs the real <see cref="Tank"/> at the same 20 Hz tick (see <c>NetArena3DScene</c>), replaying
/// the same inputs reproduces the same path, so reconciliation does not jitter. Pure C#: the wall
/// source is the same <see cref="IArena"/> the host drives against; no Godot, no transport (the
